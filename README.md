1.Local Version Control System:-
      Tracks file changes on a single system only.
      Only one developer works locally
      No collaboration features
      Example:
       RCS (Revision Control System)
       Simple idea: Store old versions on your own computer.

2.Centralized Version Control System:-
      There is one central server where all code is stored and developers commit code to it.
      Everyone works from a central repository
      Server failure can cause data loss
      Requires internet/network connection
      Examples:
       SVN (Subversion)
       CVS (Concurrent Versions System)
       Perforce
       Simple idea: One main storage — everyone connects to it.

3. Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)
   Each developer has a full copy of the repository (including history).
   Works even without internet
   Faster & more secure
   Best for team collaboration
  Examples:
   Git
   Mercurial
   Bazaar
   Simple idea: Every developer has the full project copy locally.
